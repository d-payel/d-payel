# Hi, I’m Payel Dutta

**Data Science Intern | Physics Grad**

Right now, I’m building things that make sense of markets, tweets, and everything messy in between. Interested in applying maths to real-world problems.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis | *NLP & Deep Learning*
> Developed a Bidirectional LSTM model with GloVe embeddings to classify crypto sentiment from tweets. Tackled data imbalance and overfitting to significantly improve classification performance on niche market terminology.

### 2. Crypto Volatility Prediction | *Regression & Feature Engineering*
> Built a model to forecast 30-minute BTC/USD volatility using Lasso & Ridge regression. Proved that `abs_log_return` is the strongest predictor of future risk.

### 3. Customer Segmentation & Retention | *SQL & Cohort Analysis*
> Analyzed user data to uncover retention patterns. Revealed a **>90% user drop-off after month one**, leading to data-driven recommendations for targeted reactivation campaigns.

### 4. Bike Rental Demand Analysis | *Hypothesis Testing & EDA*
> Used statistical testing to identify the core drivers of bike-sharing demand. Proved that **weather was a significant factor (P < .001)**, while day-of-week was not, informing a strategy to optimize fleet availability.

## A Bit About Me
- I’m from India and currently figuring things out (career-wise, life-wise)  
- I studied Physics, but I build with data now, and I like where it’s heading   
- I used to draw with charcoal. Still miss it! You can find my sketches [here](https://instagram.com/art.escape_dystopia)
