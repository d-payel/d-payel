## Hi, I’m Payel Dutta

**Data Analyst | Physics Grad | Learning ML One Project at a Time**

I studied Physics, but I build with data now — and I like where it’s heading. Right now, I’m building things that make sense of markets, tweets, and everything messy in between. I’m especially into financial data, crypto volatility, and finding patterns where most people see noise.


---

## What I’m Working On
- Crypto Sentiment Analysis – Scraping, cleaning, translating, labeling 1,500+ tweets to decode Bitcoin narratives  
- Volatility Prediction – Building models to forecast BTC/USD swings using historical financial data  

---

## Featured Projects
- [Crypto Volatility Prediction](https://github.com/d-payel/crypto_volatility_prediction): Used Ridge & Lasso regression, hit an R² of 0.81  
- [Tweet to Trades](https://github.com/d-payel/tweet_to_trades): From scraping to labeling to modeling Bitcoin tweet narratives  
- [Ising Model Simulation](https://github.com/d-payel/Ising-Model-Simulation): Physics + Python = nostalgic brain workout  

---

## Skills I Actually Use
- Languages: Python, SQL  
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- ML & NLP: Scikit-learn, Regression Models, TF-IDF, Text Classification  
- APIs & Web Data: REST APIs, Selenium  
- Finance: Risk analysis, market behavior understanding

---

## Currently Learning
- XGBoost, Random Forest, and ML beyond linear models  
- Social media NLP (sentiment & narrative analysis)  
- Real-time pipelines and how markets actually think

---

## A Bit About Me
- I’m from India and currently figuring things out (career-wise, life-wise)  
- Physics was my comfort zone, but now I’m learning to be okay with discomfort   
- I used to draw with charcoal. Still miss it — you can find my sketches [here](https://instagram.com/art.escape_dystopia)

*Not perfect. But building something real, one messy project at a time.*
