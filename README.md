# Hi, I’m Payel Dutta

**Data Analyst | Physics Grad | Learning ML One Project at a Time**

Right now, I’m building things that make sense of markets, tweets, and everything messy in between. I’m especially into financial data, crypto volatility, and finding patterns where most people see noise.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Crypto Volatility Prediction | *Regression & Feature Engineering*
> Built a model to forecast 30-minute BTC/USD volatility using Lasso & Ridge regression. Proved that `abs_log_return` is the strongest predictor of future risk.

### 2. Customer Segmentation & Retention | *SQL & Cohort Analysis*
> Analyzed user data to uncover retention patterns. Revealed a **>90% user drop-off after month one**, leading to data-driven recommendations for targeted reactivation campaigns.

### 3. Bike Rental Demand Analysis | *Hypothesis Testing & EDA*
> Used statistical testing to identify the core drivers of bike-sharing demand. Proved that **weather was a significant factor (P < .001)**, while day-of-week was not, informing a strategy to optimize fleet availability.

| Tech Stack | Key Result | View Repo |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Python` `Pandas` `Hypothesis Testing` | **Confirmed commuter peak hours (8AM & 5-6PM)** |  **[GitHub →](https://github.com/d-payel/Data-Analytics-01/tree/main/Hypothesis%20Testing%20on%20YULU%20Bike%20Rents)** |

## A Bit About Me
- I’m from India and currently figuring things out (career-wise, life-wise)  
- I studied Physics, but I build with data now, and I like where it’s heading   
- I used to draw with charcoal. Still miss it! You can find my sketches [here](https://instagram.com/art.escape_dystopia)
